# Figma Your Life

**Make a Figma about your life.**

You will create a prototype of a website about your life that is functional.

*(If you are not comfortable with putting out personal information, create one about an influential person.)*

This will be a **multipage** style Figma with multiple pages:

- Minimum 3 pages:
  1. Landing page
  2. Interests page
  3. Accomplishments page

Use **Bootstrap** for styling.

Figma and GitHub Repository links should be included in comments.

Figma has to be **approved** before you can start coding.

> **Late assignments will automatically receive a Zero, regardless of the price of tea in China.**
